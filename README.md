## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I built this using some HTML and CSS for content and appearance. I then used a set of event listeners and functions in JavaScript to make the information appear given a click. 


## Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot about backgrounds and borders in CSS while making this application.
